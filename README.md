# Gandalf
Because no one is wiser than Gandalf the wise.

## Note:
This is nothing less that the outcome of a few hacking sessions where I try to get better at Rust and Capnp' Proto (I'll try to do something with the actual wiki dumps related to knowledge trees)

## How's it going
Very slowly, can read multistream wikipedia dumps and create a file db with compressed Capnp'Proto encoded structs for Wikipedia pages. Somehow, it also reads them.
